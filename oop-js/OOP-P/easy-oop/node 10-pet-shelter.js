/*Consider the following code:

console.log(`${bholmes.name} has ${bholmes.numberOfPets()} adopted pets.`);

Write the classes and methods that will be necessary to make this code run, and log the following output:

P Hanson has adopted the following pets:
a cat named Butterscotch
a cat named Pudding
a bearded dragon named Darwin

B Holmes has adopted the following pets:
a dog named Molly
a parakeet named Sweetie Pie
a dog named Kennedy
a fish named Chester

P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
B Holmes has 4 adopted pets. */
